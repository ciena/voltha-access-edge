# This is an experimental docker-compose file to start the containers that represent a subscriber (OLT, ONU, and RG). This currently
# does not work because the order in which containers are connected to the custom networks is non-deterministic and the parameters
# to ponsimv2 required explicit interfaces to be named. This seems to be a known issue with docker-compose. When this issue gets 
# resolved using this file can be re-visited.
